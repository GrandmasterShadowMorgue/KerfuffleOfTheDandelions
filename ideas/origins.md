23:58 - Swift's Namesake: please
23:58 - Swift's Namesake: It's so dull
den 15 maj 2015
00:02 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: i do things in meh own time
den 14 maj 2015
23:58 - Swift's Namesake: No you don't
den 15 maj 2015
00:03 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: yes i do
den 14 maj 2015
23:58 - Swift's Namesake: That's an excuse
den 15 maj 2015
00:03 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: no it ent
den 14 maj 2015
23:58 - Swift's Namesake: It is
23:58 - Swift's Namesake: I'm fairly sure it is
den 15 maj 2015
00:03 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: tis not
den 14 maj 2015
23:59 - Swift's Namesake: Because you set goals
23:59 - Swift's Namesake: And then abandon them
23:59 - Swift's Namesake: That's not "doing things in your own time"
den 15 maj 2015
00:03 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: i dun
00:03 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: dey just gatherin dust
00:03 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: fer some toyme
den 14 maj 2015
23:59 - Swift's Namesake: We can't cooperate on stuff because you're not interested
den 15 maj 2015
00:04 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: well yp ent interested in stuff i want teh do
00:04 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: yo*
00:00 - Swift's Namesake: Newtonian
00:00 - Swift's Namesake: No commits
00:00 - Swift's Namesake: tkinter
00:00 - Swift's Namesake: You never tried doing anything with it
00:04 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: yeeeeh
00:00 - Swift's Namesake: Maybe you could make an Android app
00:00 - Swift's Namesake: That's Java
00:01 - Swift's Namesake: And yes
00:01 - Swift's Namesake: With Newtonian
00:01 - Swift's Namesake: I did too much without bringing you with me
00:01 - Swift's Namesake: Didn't step you through the process
00:02 - Swift's Namesake: Do you want to cooperate on some game/app?
00:06 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: yeeeeh
00:02 - Swift's Namesake: Which?
00:02 - Swift's Namesake: newtonian?
00:06 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: nope
00:02 - Swift's Namesake: Or something else?
00:06 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: dat adventchuh game
00:02 - Swift's Namesake: Maybe a little calculator
00:02 - Swift's Namesake: which adventure game?
00:02 - Swift's Namesake: Yours?
00:07 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: yeeeh
00:02 - Swift's Namesake: That's a school assignment
00:03 - Swift's Namesake: but ok
00:03 - Swift's Namesake: Make a repo for it
00:07 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: okaaaa
00:03 - Swift's Namesake: And download Guava
00:03 - Swift's Namesake: And add be as a contribtor
00:03 - Swift's Namesake: *contributo
00:03 - Swift's Namesake: r
00:08 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: or
00:08 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: i could keep it as meh own thing
00:08 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: and we could start afresh
00:04 - Swift's Namesake: Sure
00:04 - Swift's Namesake: Java/Haskell/Pyton/x86 assembly?
00:04 - Swift's Namesake: *Python
00:08 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: assembly for sheow mat
00:08 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: e
00:04 - Swift's Namesake: Machine code?
00:09 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: nah i think ill stick to ttl
00:04 - Swift's Namesake: seriously
00:04 - Swift's Namesake: Which language?
00:09 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: itsa toyme
00:09 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: for meh to use VS
00:05 - Swift's Namesake: Visual Studio?
00:09 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: yeeeh
00:05 - Swift's Namesake: You mean C# or C++?
00:09 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: well dunno
00:09 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: still cant decide which to pick
00:05 - Swift's Namesake: You can use Python with VIsual Studio
00:05 - Swift's Namesake: Let's NOT learn another language right now
00:05 - Swift's Namesake: You don't know C++
00:06 - Swift's Namesake: or C#
00:06 - Swift's Namesake: And I don't know C#
00:10 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: hey i know somethang
00:10 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: wid c++
00:06 - Swift's Namesake: C++
00:06 - Swift's Namesake: Is terribly complicated
00:06 - Swift's Namesake: We'll have to debug memory leaks
00:11 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: reallay?
00:07 - Swift's Namesake: Deal with manual memory allocation
00:11 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: i thought manual memory was in c
00:07 - Swift's Namesake: C++ is C + a bunch of other stuff
00:07 - Swift's Namesake: It started out as a strict superset of C
00:07 - Swift's Namesake: Hence the name
00:12 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: yeeeeh
00:08 - Swift's Namesake: If you insist
00:08 - Swift's Namesake: We could use C++ with SDL2
00:08 - Swift's Namesake: But I don't recommend it
00:08 - Swift's Namesake: As for C#
00:08 - Swift's Namesake: We'd be SO focused on learning the language, it'd detract from the process of making the game
00:13 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: plus c# is java in a different vein
00:09 - Swift's Namesake: Well
00:09 - Swift's Namesake: There are similarities
00:09 - Swift's Namesake: Certainly
00:09 - Swift's Namesake: I think we should make assets for it
00:14 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: meh dat programmin history timeline nailed it
00:09 - Swift's Namesake: They'll start out looking shit
00:10 - Swift's Namesake: But we'll learn
00:10 - Swift's Namesake: SOo
00:10 - Swift's Namesake: We could use my old idea
00:14 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: which one
00:10 - Swift's Namesake: Set it in medieval england
00:14 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: yes
00:10 - Swift's Namesake: Kerfuffle of the Dandelions
00:15 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: uhhhmmmm
00:10 - Swift's Namesake: or something to that effect
00:15 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: it started out as myyyy idea
00:10 - Swift's Namesake: No it didn't
00:10 - Swift's Namesake: Atleast not the name
00:15 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: yes it did
00:15 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: i chose the setting
00:11 - Swift's Namesake: I suggested "Parody of the War of the Roses"
00:11 - Swift's Namesake: for a theme
00:11 - Swift's Namesake: And then I came up with a few names
00:11 - Swift's Namesake: at which point you joined in
00:15 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: squabble of the sesquipedalians still pwnz
00:11 - Swift's Namesake: You may have come up with "medieval england" to begin with
00:12 - Swift's Namesake: I frankly dont' remember
00:12 - Swift's Namesake: *don'
00:12 - Swift's Namesake: t
00:12 - Swift's Namesake: We could have a few cities
00:12 - Swift's Namesake: like London
00:12 - Swift's Namesake: Use old hand-drawn maps
00:16 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: yea well
00:12 - Swift's Namesake: And narration
00:16 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: london'z
00:16 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: a
00:16 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: big city
00:17 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: even in dose timez
00:12 - Swift's Namesake: Artistic freedom
00:13 - Swift's Namesake: We could adapt them to our needs
00:13 - Swift's Namesake: Set up the repo
00:17 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: let's make a flow chart den
00:13 - Swift's Namesake: Give it a code game
00:13 - Swift's Namesake: Like
00:17 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: what waas that online shared paint thing
00:13 - Swift's Namesake: (if you want)
00:13 - Swift's Namesake: Squabble of the Liverleafs
00:18 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: hmmm
00:18 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: which language we ganna use
00:18 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: and 2d or 3d?
00:14 - Swift's Namesake: 2D
00:14 - Swift's Namesake: Maybe 2.5D
00:14 - Swift's Namesake: Like
00:18 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: sidescrollaz
00:14 - Swift's Namesake: gorgeous parallax effects
00:19 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: or we could make it fixed top down
00:14 - Swift's Namesake: but the logic is 2D
00:19 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: with real 3d assetz
00:15 - Swift's Namesake: http://flockdraw.com/9f602s
00:15 - Swift's Namesake: GTFO
00:16 - Swift's Namesake: jk
00:16 - Swift's Namesake: trapped!
00:16 - Swift's Namesake: actually
00:17 - Swift's Namesake: we should make a drawing game
00:17 - Swift's Namesake: not now though
00:21 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: ?
00:17 - Swift's Namesake: Well
00:17 - Swift's Namesake: nvm
00:17 - Swift's Namesake: Set up the repo, Jay
00:21 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: how about
00:22 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: 2.5d
00:22 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: its actually 3d
00:22 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: but with a fixed camera angle
00:17 - Swift's Namesake: yeah
00:18 - Swift's Namesake: that's what 2.5D is
00:22 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: yes but i thought you meant those sidescrolling parallax stuff
00:18 - Swift's Namesake: anyway
00:18 - Swift's Namesake: repo time!
00:22 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: oka
00:18 - Swift's Namesake: I think we should use Python
00:18 - Swift's Namesake: Hopefully it'll be fast enough
00:19 - Swift's Namesake: We could interface with C, or use some optimisation library
00:19 - Swift's Namesake: If it comes to that
00:23 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: or we could change the heavy calculation bits over to python
00:23 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: wait what
00:23 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: i meant haskell
00:19 - Swift's Namesake: Yeah
00:19 - Swift's Namesake: Well
00:19 - Swift's Namesake: Haskell via C
00:23 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: hmmmm
00:23 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: a good name for da repo...
00:24 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: oh yea i have a student github account with private repos
00:24 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: should i use that
00:20 - Swift's Namesake: Not if it'll expire when you graduate
00:20 - Swift's Namesake: I don't know what the terms are
00:24 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: i dunno eitha
00:24 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: meh
00:20 - Swift's Namesake: And do we care if it's private?
00:25 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: not really
00:20 - Swift's Namesake: That only matters if we wish to commercialise it
00:21 - Swift's Namesake: Which is unrealistic for our first joint effort
00:25 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: i dont think itll ever get that far
00:21 - Swift's Namesake: anyway
00:21 - Swift's Namesake: Let's not waste time just shooting the breeze
00:25 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: naaame
00:21 - Swift's Namesake: QuibbleOfTheBluebells
00:25 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: somethin short and snazzy
00:21 - Swift's Namesake: We CAN migrate it
00:21 - Swift's Namesake: This is just a code name
00:21 - Swift's Namesake: And it doesn't have to be the title for the game itself
00:22 - Swift's Namesake: So
00:22 - Swift's Namesake: also
00:22 - Swift's Namesake: I'll create readme/todo/license files when you're done
00:23 - Swift's Namesake: MIT license
00:23 - Swift's Namesake: http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT
00:23 - Swift's Namesake: And maybe like an assets/ideas/documentation folder
00:28 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: ok da repo izz made
00:28 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: https://github.com/GrandmasterShadowMorgue/KerfuffleOfTheDandelions
00:24 - Swift's Namesake: assets (audio, models, textures, UI strings, icons etc.)
00:24 - Swift's Namesake: ideas (our discussions about features/languages/frameworks/etc.)
00:24 - Swift's Namesake: documentation (a website maybe)
00:29 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: how do i add yeh as collabz
00:25 - Swift's Namesake: did you see?
00:30 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: what's yeh usaname
00:25 - Swift's Namesake: Click the + next to your name
00:26 - Swift's Namesake: SwiftsNamesake
00:26 - Swift's Namesake: So anyway
00:26 - Swift's Namesake: I think we should use OpenGL+pygame or PyQt
00:30 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: added
00:30 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: nyet
00:31 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: we can hazz use engine!!!
00:26 - Swift's Namesake: what engine?
00:31 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: ue4
00:27 - Swift's Namesake: Please
00:27 - Swift's Namesake: neither of us know how it works
00:31 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: unitay?
00:27 - Swift's Namesake: how well do you know unity
00:31 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: enuf to create a lil sandbox
00:27 - Swift's Namesake: so essentially
00:27 - Swift's Namesake: not much
00:32 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: and animationz
00:32 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: and scriptin
00:28 - Swift's Namesake: can't we use tools for textures/animations/models
00:28 - Swift's Namesake: assets, in one words
00:28 - Swift's Namesake: I have NO idea how we'd collaborate using an engine
00:28 - Swift's Namesake: It's just too much new stuff
00:33 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: we could create entiah scenez in blenduh
00:28 - Swift's Namesake: And it'll be a simple game to begin with
00:29 - Swift's Namesake: Well
00:33 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: just add existing objectz to one giant obj file
00:29 - Swift's Namesake: We could use engines for cinematic sequences
00:29 - Swift's Namesake: that's not a good idea...
00:33 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: yeeeh....
00:29 - Swift's Namesake: we don't want one giant obj file
00:29 - Swift's Namesake: So
00:29 - Swift's Namesake: Do you think we should use Python?
00:29 - Swift's Namesake: Are you happy with that?
00:34 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: yeh
00:30 - Swift's Namesake: A medieval RPG set in england?
00:31 - Swift's Namesake: including London-ish
00:35 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: yes
00:31 - Swift's Namesake: Sort of realistic/alternative universe/magical
00:35 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: i dont think ill add magic
00:31 - Swift's Namesake: tell you what
00:35 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: do you want to
00:31 - Swift's Namesake: Well
00:31 - Swift's Namesake: ok
00:31 - Swift's Namesake: but
00:31 - Swift's Namesake: I think it'd be fun to allude to real history
00:31 - Swift's Namesake: like include real characters
00:31 - Swift's Namesake: but play with them
00:36 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: parody em
00:32 - Swift's Namesake: as in Assassin's creed
00:32 - Swift's Namesake: yeah
00:32 - Swift's Namesake: What do you think?
00:36 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: yea
00:36 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: for sheow
00:36 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: but ima not too familia wid it
00:36 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: checkin da wiki page now
00:32 - Swift's Namesake: We'll just have to do research
00:33 - Swift's Namesake: Ok
00:33 - Swift's Namesake: I'll create a local repo and push it
00:34 - Swift's Namesake: So we have something to work with
00:38 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: oka
00:37 - Swift's Namesake: What do you think about narration?
00:37 - Swift's Namesake: And voices 'acting'?
00:37 - Swift's Namesake: *voice
00:41 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: voice acting maybe
00:41 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: mostly text i think though
00:37 - Swift's Namesake: Not narrations or introductions?
00:42 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: "and so the foolhardy knight Sir Jon of Muppetshire trundled on towards York"
00:37 - Swift's Namesake: We might have to build some kind of dialogue 'engine'
00:38 - Swift's Namesake: You should definitely write that nugget down
00:38 - Swift's Namesake: for safekeeping
00:42 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: heh
00:42 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: we should have a Muppetshire in game
00:40 - Swift's Namesake: Do you know about .gitignore?
00:40 - Swift's Namesake: It's basically a file with patterns
00:40 - Swift's Namesake: Files matching those patterns will not be tracked by git
00:45 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: oi see
00:41 - Swift's Namesake: Now you just have to clone
00:42 - Swift's Namesake: We'll have to learn about using branches and merging
00:42 - Swift's Namesake: But mainly
00:43 - Swift's Namesake: We shouldn't be working on the same piece of code both at once
00:43 - Swift's Namesake: Do you mind having your real name in the source files?
00:48 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
00:48 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: MY SECRET IDENTITY!!!
00:44 - Swift's Namesake: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO (I don't mind)
00:44 - Swift's Namesake: ok great
00:45 - Swift's Namesake: Did you notice that btw?
00:45 - Swift's Namesake: My smart snippets plugin
00:49 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: yeeeh
00:49 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: nooo
00:45 - Swift's Namesake: look
00:45 - Swift's Namesake: It inserts the current date and the name of the file
00:46 - Swift's Namesake: Don't know what to do with tabstops, though
00:46 - Swift's Namesake: Let's just agree that our source files should start like that
00:46 - Swift's Namesake: comment header / imports / code
00:46 - Swift's Namesake: ok?
00:46 - Swift's Namesake: objections or amendments?
00:51 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: nope
00:47 - Swift's Namesake: great
00:47 - Swift's Namesake: did you clone the repo?
00:51 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: yeeeh
00:48 - Swift's Namesake: So
00:48 - Swift's Namesake: I think we should start slowly
00:48 - Swift's Namesake: Like
00:48 - Swift's Namesake: do a few demos
00:48 - Swift's Namesake: Think about what features we'd like to have
00:48 - Swift's Namesake: maybe create some dummy assets
00:53 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: cubezz fer tha win
00:48 - Swift's Namesake: don't forget you can edit the readme/TODO yourself
00:49 - Swift's Namesake: what?
00:49 - Swift's Namesake: you want a cube world?
00:53 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: no
00:53 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: but dey good placeholdaz
00:49 - Swift's Namesake: ok
00:49 - Swift's Namesake: And
00:49 - Swift's Namesake: Do you have any assets you've made?
00:49 - Swift's Namesake: We could display them with my OBJ loader
00:50 - Swift's Namesake: And what do you think about using pygame/PyQt + OpenGL
00:50 - Swift's Namesake: or
00:50 - Swift's Namesake: pygame for sound (not sure of QT has that)
00:50 - Swift's Namesake: OpenGL for graphics
00:50 - Swift's Namesake: You'll have to install those things
00:50 - Swift's Namesake: nvm
00:50 - Swift's Namesake: tkinter won't work
00:50 - Swift's Namesake: it's just 2D
00:51 - Swift's Namesake: unless we hack it
00:51 - Swift's Namesake: Anyway
00:51 - Swift's Namesake: PyQt has an OpenGL view I think
00:51 - Swift's Namesake: AND it comes with widgets
00:51 - Swift's Namesake: So we can combine graphics with UI elements
00:51 - Swift's Namesake: For the menus
00:52 - Swift's Namesake: Are you still there?
00:56 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: oh wut sorry
00:52 - Swift's Namesake: You're busy elsewhere?
00:56 - Grandmaster Shadow Morgue: was chargin meh phone
00:52 - Swift's Namesake: anyway
00:52 - Swift's Namesake: If you think of something
00:52 - Swift's Namesake: or no
